# CashOrg
An app made with Flask and relational databases to help users organize their spendings. 

The user must create an username and password (that must be at least 8 digits long) and access the platform.
Then, an account must be created with an initial balance of the user's choice.

With at least one account created, the user can register different types of operations, such as incomes and expenses, as well as transfers if the user has more than onde account.
Each launch can have a diverse type of categories.

This was my final project for Harvard's CS50x, and I plan to improve it once I have more knowledge.
